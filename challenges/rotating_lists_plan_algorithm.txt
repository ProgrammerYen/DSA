We must find the number of time a list was moved forward in a cycle. When doing so, the last value moves to the first 
position in the list.

Algorithm:
1. Choose the first value in the initial sorted array
2. In the new sorted array, we also find the index of the same value and store this in a variable - using the binary search
 algorithm. The index will always be the same as there are not any repeating values - each value is unique.
3. To calculate the number of times the initial sorted array was shifted, subract the initial index from the final index. To
 avoid the initial index being larger than the final index, we must choose the first value of the sorted array and therefore
  we do not need to deal with the initial index of the first value being greater than the final index.
